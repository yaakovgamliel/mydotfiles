My DotFiles 
==
I'm traying to get what I actually really need, I hope may be helpful to you to.
 * bash
 * vim
 * tmux
 * irb

Use
==
Just clone the repo and run ```rake -T``` to check the options, double check the Rakefile before 
doing anything to your system :)

Dependencies
------
You will need rake of course and curl in order to install pathogen, if you want nice looking fonts 
for your vim's powerline status bar check out [powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).

The Vim stuff
--
Worked for me and looks really nice with MacVim if don't have any fancy pluging configuation going on already.

Note
---
Bash profiles setup needs some work, most of the bash profiles were made for macOS so i wouldn't just replace your .bashrc
with this one here

ToDo
----
I've been runnig this in Linux boxes as well so it would be nice to add some little check to properly name files according to the host system.
